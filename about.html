<h3>Ride and refurbish old bikes</h3>. <br>
These are some of the ones I've owned:
<ul>
  
  <li>1982 Miyata 110 -- My first real road bike (and I dare say my first <i>good</i> bicycle. The frame was much  small for me, but it was a good commuter until it got stolen. This bike made me realize that a good bike is actually a practical means of transporation. </li>
  
  <li>1988 Trek 1000 -- A great road bike that struck a nice balance of old-school simplicity and modern features (and compatability!). Not great for rainy Seattle commutes though...</li>
  
  <li>1980 Schwinn Voyageur 11.8 -- A previous owner spray painted the frame making it hard to identify the exact model. I took a chance and bought it for $100. After stripping away the cheap spray paint, I found the original paint was still in good shape underneath. I cleaned it up, gave it a full tune, and sold it for $125, an absolute steal! I didn't have the knowledge and appreciation for a good old touring bike that I do know. C'est la vie. The new owner knew he was getting an awesome deal. Enjoy friend!
  
  <li>Bianchi -- Bought for $8 at a garage sale, this tiny 48cm frame bike was coated in dried tire slime. I cleaned it up and and sold it for a healthy profit to help pay my rent in college. </li>
  
  <li>1974 Motobecane Grand Jubilee-- An awesome old touring bike. The previous owner rode it clear across Canada when he was younger. Super light and nimble, I really wanted to make this my primary bike, but it was trouble from the start. It was missing the Suntour Cyclone derailleur, the stronglight cranks were shark-finned, the rims weren't beaded, and the compatability issues...old french bikes man, old french bikes...</li>
  
  <li>1948 Schwinn Le Tour Luxe -- Currently my main bike. After owning it for a year, I decided to do a complete rebuild on it. I stripped it down to the frame, frame-saver'd it, replaced the brake levers, freewheel, cranks, bottom bracket, repacked the wheels, replaced the axels (one was bent!), you name it! Now why won't the brakes stop squeeling!! </li>
  
  <li> 2012 Novara Randonee -- The newest (used) bike I've ever owned. Its a great, well thought out touring bike. Many nice features, built for to be durable, and in-field repariable. Just a tad on the heavy side, and a tad too new to be fun. It didn't ever need any work done to it! Also, the stock saddle was possibly the least comfortable thing I've ever sat on. </li>
