# Bicycles

## These are some of the bikes I've owned:

* ### 1982 Miyata 110
 My first real road bike (and I dare say my first <i>good</i> bicycle). The frame was much too small for me, but it was a good commuter until it got stolen. This bike made me realize that a good bike is actually a practical means of transporation.

* ### 1988 Trek 1000
A great road bike that struck a nice balance of old-school simplicity and modern features (and compatability!). Not great for rainy Seattle commutes though...

* ### 1980 Schwinn Voyageur 11.8
A previous owner spray painted the frame making it hard to identify the exact model. I took a chance and bought it for $100. After stripping away the cheap spray paint, I found the original paint was still in good shape underneath. I cleaned it up, gave it a full tune, and sold it for $125, an absolute steal! I didn't have the knowledge and appreciation for a good old touring bike that I do know. C'est la vie. The new owner knew he was getting an awesome deal. Enjoy friend!

* ### Bianchi something
Bought for $8 at a garage sale, this tiny 48cm frame bike was coated in dried tire slime. I cleaned it up and and sold it for some extra cash while in college.

* ### 1974 Motobecane Grand Jubilee
An awesome old touring bike. The previous owner rode it clear across Canada when he was younger. Super light and nimble, I really wanted to make this my primary bike, but it was trouble from the start. It was missing the Suntour Cyclone derailleur, the Stronglight cranks were shark-finned, the rims weren't beaded, and the compatability issues...old french bikes man, old french bikes...

* ### 2012 Novara Randonee
The newest (used) bike I've ever owned. Its a great, well thought out touring bike. Many nice features, built for to be durable, and in-field repairiable. Just a tad on the heavy side, and a tad too new to be fun. It didn't ever need any work done to it! Also, the stock saddle was possibly the least comfortable thing I've ever sat on.

* ### 1948 Schwinn Le Tour Luxe
Currently my main bike. After owning it for a year, I decided to do a complete rebuild on it. I stripped it down to the bare frame, frame-saver'd it, replaced the brake levers, freewheel, cranks, bottom bracket, repacked the wheels, replaced the axles (one was bent!), ran new cables and housing...you name it! Now why won't the brakes stop squeeling?!
