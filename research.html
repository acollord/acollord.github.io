<h2> In a Nutshell: </h2>
<p> My research is focused on reducing the cost of solar energy. 
To do this, I use two different approaches: (1) studying new materials, 
like copper zinc tin sulfoselenide (CZTSSe), that are made of abundant, 
low-cost elements; and (2) developing printable inks as a new way to deposit 
these materials. CZTSSe is a relatively new material, and we need to better understand it to improve the efficiency. 
To speed up this process, I developed a combinatorial screening process that allows us to 
evaluate thousands of samples in the time it formerly took to test one. Using this technique I have mapped out 
how the properties of CZTSSe change with the relative quantites of copper, zinc, and tin. I've also looked at
how a broad array of different extrinsic elements (such as iron, antimony, sodium, etc) effect CZTSSe.
